# CV
## [Access via GitHub Pages](https://gracefry.github.io/CV/)

This project is my personal CV created using vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It showcases my journey and skills as a software developer.

I started working on this project at the end of my first year of coding (2023), and I hope over time it can reflect the strides I've made.

This project helped me build some fundamental front-end skills, and started from me being frustrated that I couldn't customise [this LaTeX CV template](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/data-science-tech-resume-template/zcdmpfxrzjhv) _quite_ to my liking.

## Features
### Interactive Sections
* The CV is designed with expandable sections, providing an engaging user experience.
* Gained a deeper understanding of HTML and CSS, emphasizing layout design, responsiveness, and styling.
### Responsive Design
* Implements CSS best practices to ensure the CV is well-proportioned and printable as an A4 document.
* Also adapts responsivelt to screen sizes including mobile screens, and has cross-browser compatiability
### JavaScript Interactivity: 
* Basic JS elements like modals, transitions, and animations bring the CV to life, enhancing the visual appeal.
* Enhanced my JavaScript skills, particularly in DOM manipulation and creating interactive elements.

## Future Enhancements
* Ideally I would like to host the website myself in the cloud
* Maybe integrate a few frameworks
* Integrate some APIs
* Nestle this within a larger project of a portfolio website containing other projects

## How to Use
