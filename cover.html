                        Dear Macquarie Graduate Recruitment Team,
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        RE: Macquarie Summer Internship Program 2023/2024 - Technology
                    </p>
                </div>
                <p> <!-- Introduction -->
                    I am writing to express my keen interest in the Technology arm of the Macquarie Summer
                    Internship Program. As a penultimate student at the University of Sydney, majoring in 
                    Computer Science and Software Development, I am excited to contribute my skills and 
                    passion to an organization that embodies
                    integrity, accountability, and embracing opportunity.
                </p>
                <p> <!-- Why this type of work? -->
                    Coming from a regional town in Victoria, I did not have many opportunities 
                    to foster my interest in technology. Nonetheless, at 11 years old,
                    I had dual-booted a Linux distribution onto our home computer 
                    and created my now decade-old Stack Exchange account. I learnt the 
                    basics of Python and Java through Coursera after my high school classes, as my all-girls school did not offer a technology curriculum. 
                    Before long, I had to shift my focus to my senior year studies and trying to get into medicine. While in my third year of study, I found myself 
                    taking another Python course under Codecademy. After much self-reflection, 
                    it dawned on me that working with technology was something I could do happily, every day; 
                    a sphere within which I could truly thrive. <br>
                    The transitions in my life have cultivated in me broad interests, an open mind, and the willingness to 
                    take risks and grow my expertise in new domains. Shemara Wikramanayake said that those at Macquarie will have the 
                    "opportunity to explore diverse career paths across the whole range of geographies and sectors in which our ever-changing business operates." I believe that I will be able to flourish in such an organisation, and use my rediscovered passion for tech to contribute to Macquarie's mission for many years to come.
                </p>
                <p> <!-- Why this organisation? -->
                    I admire Macquarie's commitment to technical innovation and its remarkable success as one of the leading digital banks in Australia. But most of all, I deeply respect its core mission to "empower people to innovate and invest for a better future", backed by its substantial contributions of over half a billion dollars to social good.
                    <br>
                    I have had the privilege of actively engaging with Macquarie through various channels, allowing me to gain valuable insights into the company's values and culture. Notably, I participated in the "Discover Her Career" program, attended the 2024 Tech Careers Night, CSESoc x WIT x SYNCS International Women's Day Networking Night, SYNCS Industry Networking Night and Workshop Interview Night. Additionally, I have played a role in organizing Macquarie-sponsored barbecues, workshops, and office tours as a SYNCS Industry Liaison.
                    Through these experiences, I have not only deepened my understanding of Macquarie as an organization but also had the privilege of connecting with remarkable current employees, whose kindness and sincerity have made a lasting impression on me.
                    </p>
                <p> <!-- Why you? -->
                    Throughout my studies, I have undertaken projects that showcase 
                    my talent for software development. Some of which are outlined in my CV,
                    particularly focusing on what I have learnt about object-oriented programming 
                    principles, test-driven development, data structures and algorithms, and systems programming.
                    I have applied this knowledge outside the classroom to develop my own personal projects and expanded my skills in 
                    full-stack web development through the Odin Project, highlighting my self-determination and capacity for self-directed learning.
                    <br>
                    Beyond my technical abilities, I have a genuine curiosity for 
                    languages and cultures. As Vice President and Treasurer of the Australian 
                    Sign Language Society, I am currently studying Auslan and 
                    exploring Deaf culture. Moreover, I have attained a high level of proficiency in Japanese, and 
                    basic proficiency in German. These experiences have honed my communication skills 
                    and fostered a natural aptitude for collaboration within diverse teams. 
                    Furthermore, with a background in medicine and extensive customer service experience 
                    spanning over seven years, I consistently prioritize care, integrity, 
                    and putting people first. I believe Macquarie Group also 
                    places significant emphasis on its people and their experience, making me a great fit.
                </p>
                <p> <!-- Closing -->
                    Overall, my experiences so far have solidified my admiration for Macquarie's dedication to technical excellence and its commitment to fostering inclusivity and empowerment through digital solutions. I am genuinely excited about the prospect of contributing to Macquarie's mission and being part of its exceptional team. 
                    <br>
