                In my computer science major, I have developed a broad and coherent body of knowledge in computer science
                and learned to apply an integrated understanding of these concepts to solve relevant problems.
                I have learned to construct models of computational processes and apply key ideas from the theory of computation and its limits.
                Furthermore, I have learned to design, construct, and explain efficient solutions to a wide range of computational tasks, both by applying known data structures and algorithms, including those found in the literature of the field, and by designing new algorithms using a range of algorithm design techniques to produce runnable implementations of these solutions.
                Importantly, I can also evaluate the correctness and efficiency of algorithms, both standard and novel, and communicate the evaluation effectively.
                Finally, I am able to design and code programs with clients to achieve an efficient computational solution to a task, working individually and as part of collaborative teams. I know how to make such solutions work with the capabilities of the hardware and software stack, and understand and explain to others how the underlying infrastructure affects application performance.

                In my software development major, I have learned to design, construct and deliver usable software artefacts of small- to medium-scale, that meet usersâ€™ requirements and are well-structured, working both individually and as part of a team.
                This includes the ability to evaluate and report on the quality and utility of software, and to explain decisions about software functionality, structure and design choices to influence others in evaluating the software artefacts.
                In my studies, I have come to exhibit a broad and coherent body of knowledge in software development, learning new tools, languages, processes and technologies. I can recognise and describe a diversity of programming paradigms and platforms, and use and apply contemporary software development tools and practices.
                I follow and apply processes to ensure the delivery of quality artefacts within resource constraints. Overall, I have learned to address authentic problems in software development, working professionally, ethically and responsibly within diverse, collaborative and interdisciplinary teams.
