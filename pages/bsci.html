            <p>My first Linux distro was Ubuntu 12.04, dual-booted when I was 11 years
                old. I have always loved experimenting with tech, and now I am working
                to combine that fascination with my experiences studying medicine, LOTE
                and psychology to make a meaningful impacts in the lives of others.</p>
            <p>Now in my penultimate year at the University of Sydney, I have developed
                solid skills in Python, Java, C, Object-Oriented Programming (OOP),
                data structures and algorithms, and more. As a passionate autodidact,
                I have also taught myself the basics of web development, specifically
                HTML/CSS, JavaScript and the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React and Node).
            </p>
            <p>
                In my spare time, I love learning about languages and cultures other
                than my own. Currently, I am studying Auslan and Deaf culture through
                my role as Vice President of the Australian Sign Language Society. I
                am also trying to maintain my proficiency in Japanese after receiving
                the VCE Premier's Award in Year 10 and continuing my studies at the
                University of Melbourne in Year 11. I love connecting with interesting
                people and I am passionate about making opportunities, spaces and ideas
                more accessible to everyone.</p>
